# Covetous Gold Serpent Ring

The Gold Serpent Ring adds at least 50 points to your Item Discovery. Four
variations of the ring exist, each variation adding more points to your Item
Discovery than the previous variation:

-   +0: NG+0, Profaned Capital, 50
-   +1: NG+1, Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, 75
-   +2: NG+2, Archdragon Peak, 100
-   +3: NG+0, Ringed City, 115

Each variation of the ring does not stack with any other variation. However,
each variation of the Gold Serpent Ring stacks with the Symbol of Avarice and
the Crystal Sage's Rapier. If you equip both the Gold Serpent Ring+3 and the
Symbol of Avarice, they would boost your Item Discovery. The stacking is
multiplicative rather than additive, resulting in an extra point added to your
Item Discovery. The +0 and +3 versions of the ring are found in NG+0. Unless you
want to obtain all rings for the Master of Rings achievement, you do not require
the +1 and +2 versions in order to farm items.
