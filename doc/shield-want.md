# Shield of Want

The Shield of Want allows you to absorb 20% more souls from defeated enemies.
You still get the percentage bonus even if you don't meet the stats requirement
to wield the shield. The percentage bonus is fixed and upgrading the shield does
not increase the number. However, the percentage bonus does stack with the
Silver Serpent Ring(+0,+1,+2,+3), Symbol of Avarice, and Mendicant's Staff. The
shield is found in Smouldering Lake next to the Carthus Sand Worm. As long as
you have not turned off the giant ballista, the Carthus Sand Worm can easily be
cheesed by letting the ballista kill the worm for you. Stand at a specific
location near the worm, wait a few minutes while the ballista shoots at you and
the worm, and then grab the shield once the worm is dead.
