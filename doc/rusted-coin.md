# Rusted (Gold) Coin

These coins allow you to temporarily boost your Item Discovery by at least 50
points for 60 seconds. When you are farming for items, popping a Rusted Coin
would increase your Item Discovery by 50 points, an effect that lasts for 60
seconds. Popping a Rusted Gold Coin would boost your Item Discovery by 100
points for 60 seconds. The Undead Settlement is the earliest part of the game
where you are able to obtain 2 Rusted Coins. To purchase an unlimited number of
Rusted Coins, consider doing Patches' quest line. When you create your character
before you start the game, you have a choice of 7 Rusted Gold Coins as your
burial gift. There are a limited number of Rusted Gold Coins that can be
obtained throughout the game. However, the Rusted (Gold) Coins can be farmed
from the Jailer Handmaids in the Profaned Capital. See these pages for more
