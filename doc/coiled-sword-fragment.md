# Coiled Sword Fragment

The Coiled Sword Fragment is probably the most neglected item when it comes to
farming. One reason is that various alternatives exist. The other reason is that
getting to the area where the Coiled Sword Fragment is located can be very
difficult, especially for low-level characters.

The Coiled Sword Fragment can be traded with "Pickle Pee, Pump-a-Rum", the crow
above the normal Firelink Shrine, for a Titanite Slab. However, the real purpose
of the Coiled Sword Fragment is to be an infinite use Homeward Bone. After
completing one round of farming in an area, use the item to return to the last
bonfire you rested at. The item would save you a lot of hassle buying Homeward
Bones. The Homeward miracle also acts as an infinite use Homeward Bone, as long
as you have the required FP and at least 18 Faith. Finally, the Darksign is also
an infinite use Homeward Bone, but using it would cost you all the souls you
have. I highly recommend you obtain the Coiled Sword Fragment as early as
possible as it is an immense quality of life improvement for anyone who wants to
farm anything in-game.

The Coiled Sword Fragment is found in dark Firelink Shrine. This area can only
be accessed after you have defeated Dancer, Oceiros, and Champion Gundyr in this
order. Of the 3 bosses, Dancer is the most difficult, especially if you want to
fight her early in the game and for low-level characters. I now discuss some
strategies for fighting these bosses.

The Dancer is probably the most difficult of the 3 bosses in the route to obtain
the Coiled Sword Fragment. If you have trouble fighting her, consider using any
combination of these strategies and/or look up online for more strategies.

1. Summon 3 player phantoms to help you gank the Dancer. Early in the life cycle
   of DS3, there was a glitch that allows you to summon the Sword Master in such
   a way that Dancer wouldn't be able to hit him. Using this glitch you would be
   able to cheese Dancer by letting the Sword Master do all the fighting for
   you. Unfortunately, the glitch has been patched a long time ago. However, you
   can still summon the Sword Master for the Dancer fight, provided you have
   first defeated the Sword Master near Firelink Shrine and Vordt is still
   alive. Before defeating Vordt, you would be able to summon the NPC Lion
   Knight Albert. If you summon him for the Dancer fight, he would Black Crystal
   out whenever you enter Dancer's boss arena. If you want to summon phantoms to
   help you gank Dancer, it's usually best to summon the phantoms of players
   rather than NPC phantoms.
1. Equip a medium or great shield having high Stability to block the Dancer's
   attacks. If you don't want to roll through the Dancer's attacks, consider
   using a shield to block her attacks. Experiment with various shields to see
   which one suits your needs. After blocking her attack, use a straight sword
   to hit with an R1. Buff your straight sword with Gold Pine Resin/Bundle
   and/or Human Pine Resin, both of which are effective against the Dancer. You
   can also use Charcoal Pine Resin/Bundle, but it is not as effective as the
   other two elemental buffs. If you want, equip the Sun Princess Ring for some
   HP regen as you fight Dancer.

1. Equip a Blessed infused weapon and the Sun Princess Ring for HP regen. Use a
   Chaos or lightning infused straight sword to deal damage.
1. Use Pestilent Mist to cheese the Dancer. This strategy requires you to do
   Orbeck's quest line and have 30 Intelligence in order to use Pestilent Mist.

1. Two-hand the Tailbone Short Sword or Spear. Go behind a pillar and weapon art
   the Dancer when she is on the other side of the pillar. This is similar to
   the Pestilent Mist cheese, but using the Tailbone weapons. The Tailbone Short
   Sword requires 8 Strength and 14 Dexterity, while the Tailbone Spear requires
   13 Strength and 15 Dexterity. Both weapons can be farmed from the Wretches,
   pale dragon-like creatures in Irithyll Dungeon.
1. Use the weapon art of the Millwood Greatbow, a weapon found in the Ashes of
   Ariandel DLC. Once you have the bow and the Captain's Ashes, give the ashes
   to the Shrine Handmaid so that you would be able to purchase Millwood
   Greatarrows. Trigger the boss fight, quit and restart your game, and use the
   glowing flame of the Dancer's sword to help you aim. This cheese can be used
   even if your character is SL1. The reason is that you don't need to meet the
   stats requirement of the Millwood Greatbow in order to use its weapon art.
   However, without having the stats to wield the Millwood Greatbow, the damage
   output of the weapon art would be greatly reduced. Even at SL1, you can
   slightly increase the damage output of the weapon art by equipping Lloyd's
   Sword Ring, have your weight ratio below 30%, and equip Flynn's Ring. If you
   want, also equip the Farron Ring to reduce the FP cost of the weapon art.
   Ensure you have a few Ashen Estus uses and plenty, and various types, of
   great arrows. Consider doing Greirat's quest line, thus allowing you to
   purchase Dragonslayer Greatarrows and Dragonslayer Lightning Arrows.
